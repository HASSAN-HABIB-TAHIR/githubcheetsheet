# VCS Kind of Database

- vcs options include Git, Mercurial, SVN and preforce.
- You can think of a vcs as a kind of "database".
- It lets you save a snapshot of your complete project at any
  time you want
- When you later take a look at an older snapshot your vcs
  shows you exactly how it differed from the previous one

- the most important question: How do you know what exactly is different in these versions?

### Why Use a version control System.

- Version control system acknowledgement that here is only one project
- Therefore ,there only the one version on your disk that you'r currently working on.
- Everything else - all the past versions and variants - are neatly packed up inside the VCS.
- When you need it , you can request any version at any time and you'll have snapshot of the complete project right at hand
